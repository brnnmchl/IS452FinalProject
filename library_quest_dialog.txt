AGNES:

Welcome to the Library.
I am AGNES.
What can I call you?


AGNES:

This must be your first day.
Well, don't worry, we here at the
Library are all quite friendly.
I'm sure you'll enjoy working here.


AGNES:

What position are you starting today?


AGNES:

Ah yes! We've been excited to have
you join us! I hope you'll have many
wonderful adventures while working here.


AGNES:

Oh my! CLARENCE,
what is going on?


CLARENCE:

It's terrible, AGNES!
The dean has finally made his decision!


AGNES:

No! It can't be!


CLARENCE:

Unfortunately it's true. We're going to
be tracking patrons' borrowing history
in the TOME OF LENDING!


CLARENCE:

DEAN PATRICK ARCHY has already
locked it in the ADMIN'S TOWER!


AGNES:

Oh, it's too horrible...
and with the LIBRARY RELICS
scattered throughout the Library...
Whatever shall we do?


CLARENCE:

There might still be a chance!


CLARENCE:

If you can gather the LIBRARY RELICS
and destroy the TOME OF LENDING,
we might be able to stop this madness!


CLARENCE:

Four magical treasures that grant
the user incredible powers.


CLARENCE:

The CARDIGAN OF INVISIBILITY,
the SPECTACLES OF COMPUTER SIGHT,
the BOTTOMLESS MUG,
and the THOUSAND SHELF BOOKCART.


AGNES:

But the RELICS have been scattered
throughout the Library for many
years, and it will be no small task
to find them all.


AGNES:

You will face many dangers and
encounter many traps along the way.


AGNES:

Oh, thank you, thank you!


AGNES:

But you must hurry!


AGNES:

Down those stairs you will find the
ARCHIVIST'S LAIR. There you will
find the CARDIGAN OF INVISIBILITY.


???:

Ah... what do we have here? What
unsuspecting victi- I mean, potential
researcher has found their way into
my humble archive?


???:

Oh! How exciting! It's been so long
since we've welcomed a new member into
our little family here at the Library.


???:

And after what happened to your poor
predecessor, well...


???:

But where are my manners?I! I am
B. B. N. Knope, the Archivist.


KNOPE:

You wouldn't, perchance, have been sent
down to do a little bit of processing,
would you?


KNOPE:

You know, we're always buried under
a backlog, with new materials coming
in every day... It's a nightmare!


KNOPE:

So... do you have a minute?
Hour? Day? Year or ten to spare?


KNOPE:

Pity. It was worth a try.
So, what can I help you with?


KNOPE:

Did you even submit a materials request
before you came down here?


KNOPE:

I'm sure it is, but still...


KNOPE:

Oh! I've got it!


KNOPE:

Help me solve a little... missing
materials problem, and I'll give you
the RELIC.


KNOPE:

Buuuut... if you can't solve the puzzle,
you'll have to stay here and process our
backlog.


KNOPE:

Have we got a deal?


KNOPE:

Excellent!


KNOPE:

Well, I must say, I wasn't sure you'd
figure that one out. Well done.


KNOPE:

I suppose a deal is a deal... Here you go.


KNOPE:

If you're sure you want to continue, I'd
recommend looking for the next RELIC in the
CATALOGER'S DUNGEON.


KNOPE:

Oh, it's just as terrifying as it
sounds. Don't worry.


KNOPE:

You'll find the stairs to the DUNGEON
over on the far wall there, behind some
stacks of film reels.


KNOPE:

Good luck.


???:

What are you doing here?


???:

A quest? We don't have time for
quests! There are materials that
need describing!


???:

You must mean the SPECTACLES OF
COMPUTER SIGHT.


???:

The SPECTACLES are sacred to us
catalogers. We won't part with them
easily, not even for a quest like this.


???:

I suppose I might be able to... work
something out. But you won't get them
for free!


GHER:

I am VOYA GHER, Head Cataloging Tactician
and Metadata Strategist.


GHER:

As I mentioned, we are very busy here
and after the debacle that was the last
OCLC undercover retrieval mission we've
had some... unexpected downsizing in our
ranks.


GHER:

If you can help me deliver these new
materials to the proper cataloger, I'll
give you the SPECTACLES. Sound fair?


GHER:

You'd make a pretty good
cataloging peon...


GHER:

Well, I suppose you earned this.
Here.


GHER:

If ithe situation is as dire as you
make it sound, you'd probably best
get a move on.


GHER:

I'll let you use my interdepartmental
portal, if you like. It'll take you
right outside the REFERENCE TAVERN.


GHER:

Any question you have, I guarantee
they've got the answer.


GHER:

In you go. I recommend you talk to 
VIEU PHIND. She can help you locate
the next RELIC.


???:

Welcome to the REFERENCE TAVERN!


PHIND:

I'm VIEU PHIND.
How can I help you today?


PHIND:

A quest! How exciting!
What is your quest?


PHIND:

I see. That's a tricky task you have
there. Where have you looked so far?


PHIND:

That's great! Archives have many excellent
resources. How else have you approached
your search?


PHIND:

Fantastic! Since catalogers are
responsible for creating records so
that users can find materials in the
Library, they are excellent comrades
when designing a search strategy.


PHIND:

You seem to be doing well in you
search so far. Tell me a little
more about your quest.


PHIND:

Oh! VOYA sent you?! They are such a
sweetheart!


PHIND:

Well, if VOYA sent you, it must be
very urgent, your quest.


PHIND:

So you're looking for the next
LIBRARY RELIC... Let me see...


PHIND:

The first thing to do is open up the
Library catalog. Up at the top of the
page, you'll see a search box.


PHIND:

Let's try typing in 'library' AND 'relic'
to see what we have in our holdings.


PHIND:

Oh! Look at that! It looks like we have
four LIBRARY RELICS. Two of them are
checked out, but it looks like the other
two are available.


PHIND:

Let's see... Looks like the THOUSAND SHELF
BOOKCART is the CASTLE OF STACKS and the 
BOTTOMLESS MUG is...


PHIND:

Oh! Well, I guess it's your lucky day. It
seems the BOTTOMLESS MUG is here at the
REFERENCE TAVERN!


PHIND:

Hmm... it seems it's a
non-circulating item...


PHIND:

Well... I suppose I might be able to make
an exception... But I'll need a favor from
you first.


PHIND:

I've got some patrons on chat that need
database recommendations. If you help
direct them to the right databases, I'll
give you the MUG.


PHIND:

Sound fair?


PHIND:

Wow! You're pretty good at this!


PHIND:

Fair's fair, here you go.


PHIND:

Our catalog search showed that the last
RELIC is in the CASTLE OF STACKS. Let
me see...


PHIND:

Okay, it looks like the directions have
been included her ein the catalog record.


PHIND:

Remember these! Any wrong durn in the 
STACKS could leave you wandering aimlessly
for eternity.


PHIND:

Alright, you'll head down to the lowest
and then the directions are...


PHIND:

You can find the door to the STACKS
just up those stairs, at the back of
the room.


PHIND:

Have a good quest!


ANTELOPE:

Is an antelope a document?


???:

Ah, hello there. Are you lost?
Can I help you?


???:

Ah, did the Reference Librarians send
you? That was kinda harsh.


DEWEY:

I'm Librarian Commander Dewey of the
Stacks Brigade, but you can just call
me Dewey.


DEWEY:

What item were you looking for?


DEWEY:

Oooooooohhhhhhhh... Wow. I never thought
this day would come...


DEWEY:

There's an old story amongst the Brigade
that one day the Once and Future Librarian
would return to reclaim the BOOKCART.


DEWEY:

*whispering*

The boys are never going to believe this.


DEWEY:

If you managed to make it through the
Stacks on your own, it's got to be a
sign!


DEWEY:

Even trained members of the Stacks
Brigade usually get turned around for
a day or two before they make it to
their destination!


DEWEY:

Here we are!


DEWEY:

No, silly. The BOOKCART's inside the
book. Go on! Open it!


DEWEY:

Oh... my... I-I can't BELIEVE THIS
IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING!!


DEWEY:

Can I... Can I get your autograph?


DEWEY:

Wow...


DEWEY:

I, um, I guess you've got to be
off then.


DEWEY:

Sure. The Stacks are a puzzle in and of
themselves, so you pretty much already
proved yourself as far as I'm concerned.


DEWEY:

Sure thing! Just, climb on and
tell it where to go!


DEWEY:

Good luck on your quest!


DEWEY:

DEAN PATRICK ARCHY is no pushover,
but I believe you can beat him.


DEWEY:

He'll be up in the ADMIN'S TOWER.


ARCHY:

Come in!


ARCHY:

I had such high hopes for you, but
gathering the RELICA? Trying to foil
my nefarious plot?


ARCHY:

*sighs* It just won't do.


ARCHY:

Guess I'll have to terminate your
contract early.


ARCHY:

Oh, honestly. Can't you even try
to finish the game? After all, you
got this far.


ARCHY:

*sigh* Well, it doesn't matter anymore.
I have work to do.


ARCHY:

Come in!


ARCHY:

Come now, surely you didn't think I was
that foolish.


ARCHY:

Ah, well, I suppose this is where your
quest ends.


ARCHY:

You will pay for your treachery!
