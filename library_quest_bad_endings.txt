You leave and settle for a life of working odd,
unfulfilling jobs, full of regret at the adventure
you missed out on.


The floor opens up beneath you
and you are devoured by silverfish.


The world crumbles to chaos.
You see yourself twenty years
from now living the real live
version of 1984.


You are magically bound to remain
in the archive until you have finished
processing the back log.


In your attempt to flee, you trip
over a pile of boxes/papers and are
dragged by a horde of giggling archive
gnomes into the darkness. You are
never heard from again.


You see something shiny on the
ground and bend to take a look. It's
a paper clip. There is another, not
too far away. Soon you have followed
the trail of paper clips into the gloom
You are trapped. There is no way out.


You feel a hand on your back and
you are firmly pushed into the
portal. You are falling, and falling,
and falling, and falling...


GHER grins eerily and the sound of
typing suddenly falls silent. Hundreds
of identical, bespectacled stares turn
towards you. You turn, but there is no
longer a door behind you. A pair of
glasses descends in front of your eyes
and you know no more.


You hear a sound much like a muffled
scream. Shadowy hand suddenly burst
from the rough stone walls and you are
dragged into the darkness.


You hesitate and glance back. The
cat stares at you with it's soulful
eyes. Perhaps... perhaps you'd be
better off petting it...


PHIND grins and reaches up. Her fingers
seem to peel away her face and suddenly
you realize it is a mask. She hands you
the enchanted customer service mask. You
take it, resigned to an eternity trapped
in customer service.


PHIND shrugs and directs you towards
the table with the cat. You find
minimal comfort as you pet it, and
pet it, and pet it, and pet it...


The cat is indeed as fluffy as it
appeared. Time seems to slip away
from you as you continue to pet it,
and pet it, and pet it, and pet it...


The comforting feeling dissipates and
is replaced by a poignant feeling of
foreboding. You hear a sound and turn
to see an ominous forest behind you. One
pair of eyes, the then two, three, four,
appear in the shadows. No one hears you
scream.


You tell the BOOKCART to take
you home and live the rest of
your days regretting letting
down the good people of the
Library.


You, rather cruelly, stomp all
over DEWEY's dreams and crush her
belief in humanity.


You stare at the book and feel a
wave of anxiety crash over you.


You're not sure you're ready to be
the Once and Future Librarian, and
you sadly hand the book back to DEWEY.


From within the stacks, a creature
appears its horns tall and twisted,
its eyes bright red and terrifying.


It utters one question...


You are frozen in terror, your
mind slowly dissolving as you
try to come up with the answer.


The last thing you hear is the
horrible laughter of the ANTELOPE
as it claims another victim.
