GAME PLAY

Decisions:
	At some points in the game, players will be asked yes or no questions
	to move forward in the story.

	Most entry boxes will require a [yes] or [no] response. Any additional
	entry boxes will make it clear with either the prompt or a list of options
	what is expected as a response.
	
Logic puzzles:
	For the puzzles, use the grid as a guide to work out the answers before
	entering them one by one into the entry boxes. Click "Submit" after every
	entry.
