Years of study, thousands of bowls of ramen, and the
sweet embrace of caffeine have led you to this moment.
All of your hard work has finally paid off and you feel
a thrill of excitement as you approach the intimidating
oak door. You’re finally here…


You are greeted inside
by an elderly woman.


Select one:

Adult Services Librarian
Archivist
Cataloger
Instruction Librarian
Reference Librarian
Subject Specialist
Youth Services Librarian


You hear a loud crash and both
you and AGNES turn to see a young
man rushing towards you.


AGNES points towards a stone archway
where you can see a flight of stairs
leading down into the darkness.


A cool, musty smelling breeze wafts
out of it and you feel a little
shiver of fear.


You grit your teeth and square
your shoulders. You're ready for
this. It's what all those MLIS
classes have prepared you for.


You walk over to the archway.


You walk cautiously down the stairs,
keeping you wits about you as the smell
of dust and old paper grows stronger and
stronger.


The further down you descend, you see
more and more archaic and mysterious
items hanging on the walls.


At last you reach a door, flaking black
lettering proclaiming,

"Archives: Beware all ye who enter here."


Taking a steadying breath, you reach
for the door...


You push open the door, stepping
into what appears to be a cave filled
with shelves all lined with rows and
rows of uniform grey boxes.


You're sure there are tables and chairs
somewhere, but they have long been
buried under the mountains and drifts
of paper and memorabilia.


A sudden shuffling sound to your left
makes you start in alarm.


A tall, skeletal looking old man is
grinning at you, eyes glittering behind
his slightly off-kilter glasses.


He's impeccably dressed, but there's dust 
on his knees, scrapes on his knuckles, and
paper cuts on his hands.


You've read about people like this
man before... Archivists.


The CARDIGAN OF INVISIBILITY is now
in your inventory!


You watch as KNOPE seems to disappear
into the chaos of the archive.


Eager to move on, you head towards the
door and find it slightly ajar. A chill
seems to hover around it and you think
you can hear... something.


As you descend the staircase, the air
grows colder and the light dimmer.


The sound you heard before grows louder,
and though you can't quite place it yet,
it sounds familiar.


Clackclackclackclack


At the bottom of the staircase, through
the gloom you see a rusted metal door, a
sign dangling from one screw in the upper
right corner reading,

"Catalog at your own risk."


You open the door as quietly as possible
and suddenly the noise from before makes
sense.


Spread out before you is a seemingly
endless room filled with the hazy blue
glow of computer screens.


At each of the terminals, a cataloger
sits hunched over, fingers flying across
their key boards or clicking their mouse.


Their bloodshot eyes reflect the glow
of their computer screens eerily.


The sharp, hissing whisper nearly
makes you jump out of your skin and
you turn to see one of the catalogers,
their large glasses reflecting the
light from a nearby monitor.


The cataloger raises an eyebrow. You
think they might be glaring at you, but
you can't be sure.


The cataloger stares at you
unnervingly.


The SPECTACLES OF COMPUTER SIGHT
are now in your inventory!


GHER directs you to a shadowy alcove
where a strange circle of glowing
liquid seems to be floating on the wall.


You try not to stare too much. After
all, you've definitely read about
interdepartmental portals and you
don't want to look like too much of
a newbie.


GHER pokes at the glowing liquid a
few times and then gestures for you
to step forward.


You pass through the portal and
experience a sensation not unlike
getting unceremoniously dropped in
a puddle.


As you emerge, spluttering on the
other side, you are surprised to feel
a comforting warmth accompanied by
the sounds of gentle music and laughter.


Before you, you see a cozy looking
building with pleasant planters full
of petunias sitting outside and a warm
glow in the windows.


Above the door, a handsom sign proclaims,

"REFERENCE TAVERN"


You step through the door and are greeted
by the sight of a charming room filled with
tables and chatting patrons.


At each table, a patron sits with a person
in a uniform shirt, pouring over books or
looking at convenient computer screens
showing journal databases.


Off to the side, you see two tables empty
of patrons.


At one, there is a young woman with
impeccably done cat-eye eyeliner,
smiling and waving you over.


At the other, there is a cat, its
eyes hypnotic and its fur appearing
enticingly fluffy.


PHIND turns to the computer sitting on
the table, turning the screen towards you.


PHIND looks at you, face thoughtful.
You give her the best puppy-dog eyes you
can muster. It's one of your many hidden
talents, after all.


The BOTTOMLESS MUG is now
in your inventory!


Once you enter the STACKS, go:

LEFT, RIGHT, RIGHT, FORWARD,
LEFT, FORWARD, RIGHT.


You and PHIND stare at each other for
a long, awkward moment before you turn
and beat a hasty retreat.


At the back of the room, you find the
stairs PHIND mentioned.


You cautiously make your way up
the stairs, the soothing sounds of
the tavern falling away behind you.


At the top, you see a door decorated
with intricate ironwork depicting
some sort of stylized horned creature.


You push the door open cautiously
and immediately feel you breath
catch.


Beyond is a vast labyrinth of
book stacks, twisting and twining
for as far as the eye can see.


You are standing on a platform and
a staircase to your left leads down
several stories.


Taking a steadying breath, you descend
the stairs, passing floor and floor
of dark, ominous bookshelves.


Once you reach the bottom floor, you
are faced with three options.


You get the distinct feeling
you're being watched. You come
to another intersection...


You think you hear something
moving in the shadows, but you
press on...


You're almost halfway there,
so far so good. Right?


From the corner of your eye, you
think you see a flash of red.


The stacks feel close, you feel
your heartbeat speed up.


You are so close now... but what
was that? Is it getting closer?


You turn the final corner and almost
run straight into a young woman
balanced precariously on a stool, a
stack of books in her arms.


Luckily, you took Self-Defense for the
Subject Librarian last semester, so
you're quick on your feet.


With lightning quick movements, the
young woman shelves the books, her
hands moving almost too fast for you
to see.


When she's done, she turns and peers
down at you curiously.


You gesture vaguely.


DEWEY climbs down from her stool
and practically bounces over to
you, her excitement palpable.


DEWEY turns and starts scanning the
shelves around you both. After a moment,
she grins and reaches for a thick,
leather-bound volume.


You flip the cover back and a burst
of color and sound issues from the
pages.


You are blinded by the brilliance for
a moment, and when you can see again,
the BOOKCART is sitting before you.


The THOUSAND SHELF BOOKCART
is now in your inventory!


DEWEY dances around the BOOKCART,
eyes wide in wonder. After fawning
over it for a few moments, DEWEY
turns back to you.


You nod and then turn to
the BOOKCART.


You realize you have no idea how
you're going to carry a BOOKACART
or where you're supposed to go next.


DEWEY nods and pats the top
of the BOOKCART.


You stare at it for a moment before
deciding you've definitely done
weirder things before.


While DEWEY steadies the cart,
you climb aboard.


As soon as you utter your destination,
the BOOKCART rockets off.


Colors rush by, all blurred together
as you hurtle along through the Library.


And just as quickly as you took off, the
BOOKCART stops, nearly throwing you
clear across the spacious lobby area
you landed in.


The lobby has only one door, which
seems suspicious, made of polished
mahogany and glass with neat, golden
lettering.


Office of DEAN PATRICK ARCHY


your heart pounds in your ears. This
is it. You're finally here. The final
showdown.


You climb off the cart and consider
what to do.


You coud knock, equip the RELICS,
or just leave...


You march up to the door, ready
to do battle, and knock three times.


From behind the door, you hear a
sickly sweet voice call out...


You open the door and charge in,
expecting a fight, but what you see
is a rather terrifying man.


He wears a pristine suit and his
eyes are like a snake's, pinning
you in place.


He smiles, his teeth blindingly
white and razor sharp.


Before you can make a move, ARCHY
catches your eye and using some sort
of dark, admin arts, he turns you to
stone.


Knowing that you'd give yourself away,
you hold still, waiting with bated breath
until you hear ARCHY stand with a grumble
and start walking towards the door.


You step back slightly as the door opens
and a man so terrifying you almost freeze
looks out.


He wears a pristine suit and his eyes,
like a snake's, survey the lobby.


You can feel all your frustration and
rage at the state of the world well up
within you just by looking at him.


Before you can make a move, he turns his
gaze on you and smiles, his teeth
blindingly white a razor sharp.


Using soem sort of dark, admin arts,
he immediately turns you to stone.


You feel whatever courage you had
dissipate in the face of this door.


Shaking your head and sending a
silent apology to all the poor souls
of the Library you will suffer for your
cowardice, you hop back on the BOOKCART.


You ask the BOOKCART to take you
anywhere but here.


There is a whoosh and a blur of color,
and you find yourself in front of a
desk where a terrifying man sits, his
snake-like eyes unamused as he sets his
pen down.


He catches your eye and using some
sort of dark, admin arts, turns you
to stone.


You pull on the CARDIGAN OF INVISIBILITY
and don the SPECTACLES OF COMPUTER
SIGHT. In one hand, you ready the
BOTTOMLESS MUG.


With Trepidation, you move forward
and knock on the door.


From behind the door, you hear a
sickly sweet voice call out...


You see a terrifying man sitting
behind a desk, his snake-like eyes
staring towards the door. ARCHY
raises an eyebrow, setting his pen
down and sighing heavily as if he
were mildly annoyed.


Standing, he moves faster than you can
react and grabs your arm, pulling off
the CARDIGAN as he shakes his head in
disappointment.


Using some dark, admin arts, he turns
you to stone.


Knowing that you'd give yourself away,
you hold still, waiting with bated 
breath until you hear ARCHY stand with
a grumble and start walking towards
the door.


You step back slightly as the door opens
and a man so terrifying you almost
freeze looks out. He wears a pristine
suit and his eyes, like a snake's,
survey the lobby. 


You can feel all your frustration and
range at the state of the world well
up within you just by looking at him.


You can no longer fight your rage, and
letting out a battle cry, strike out at
ARCHY, landing a punch right on his
obnoxiously strait nose.


Your victory is short-lived, however, 
as ARCHY reels back, snake eyes blazing.
He turns back, reaching out with lightning
quick reflexes and grabs your arm, pulling 
off the CARDIGAN and catching your eye. 
Using some dark, admin arts, he turns
you to stone.


Steeling yourself against making any
rash moves, you slip around him and
into the office, thankful for the
CARDICAN's powers.


Inside the office, you see two possible
locations for the TOME OF LENDING to be
held: a bookshelf and a desk.


You see several old volumes slumping
haphazardly on the various shelves.
None of them seem to stand out to you
until you spy one bound in bright red
cloth.


You reach out and tug the red book free,
but in your haste, forgot some basic
principles of physics. As the red books
slides out, the other volumes it had been
supporting tumble over, each one making
a loud thump as it does.


Immediately, ARCHY turns away from the
door, his snake eyes fixed on the
bookshelf and sees the red book floating
there.


Leaping forward, he snags your arm, making
you drop the book as he tugs the CARDIGAN
off you. His eyes blazing, he meets your
gaze and using dark, admin arts, turns you
to stone.


You think to yourself that a bookshelf
would be too simple of a hiding place and
turn towards the desk.


On top of it, you see ARCHY's computer
desktop and a sheaf of loose papers.


You reach for the papers, but forget
you're holding the BOTTOMLESS MUG. Your
favorite beverage starts to pour out
of it and all over the desk, surprising
you.


In your attempt to fix this disaster, you
drop the MUG, scatter the papers, and
make a pretty big racket.


Immediately, ARCHY turns away from the
door, his snake eyes fixed on the
desk where the BOTTOMLESS MUG is making
a mess of the papers.


Leaping forward, he dashes around the
desk, snags your arm, and tugs the
CARDIGAN off you. His eyes blazing, he
meets your gaze and using dark, admin
arts, turns you to stone.


You remember from your Libraries and
the Digital Age course taht many more
library services are being shifted to
digital management systems.


Glancing at the computer screen, you
see two folders, one labeled,

"CAT MEMES"

and one labeled,

"NEFARIOUS PLOT"


You click on the CAT MEMES folder and
are bombarded with a collection so
incredible, so mind-boggling, you are
too stunned to move.


When ARCHY eventually decides there's
no one in the lobby, he returns to the
desk and bumps into you. Furrowing his
brows, he tugs the CARDIGAN off and
chuckles.


You've been entranced by the power of
the cat memes and no longer pose a
a threat to him. Calling in a
Secretary, he chuckles darkly to himself
as your catatonic form is carted away,
secure in the knowledge that there are
none left to foil his NEFARIOUS PLOT.


You take a closer look at the screen,
removing the SPECTACLES then putting
them on again and notice that you can
only see the NEFARIOUS PLOT folder
with them on.


Knowing this is what you are after, you
quietly click on the folder and see a
single file inside:

The TOME OF LENDING.


The moment of truth is upon you.


Really? You are literally one step away
from completing this quest.


At this point, you probably deserve to
have ARCHY turn you to stone.


You take a deep, quiet breath and raise
the BOTTOMLESS MUG. In one swift motion,
you upend the MUG over the computer,
dowsing it in your favorite beverage.


The computer lets out a sad cough and
a puff of smoke, the screen flickering
before going out. A few parks shoot
out, and your quest is complete.


At the sounds of the computer dying,
DEAN PATRICK ARCHY, turns with
lightning quick reflexes, his snake
eyes raking over the office. With long,
angry strides, he heads towards the,
desk...


You move without thinking, dodging to
the left and right into the path of
ARCHY. You smash into him and fall
back, the SPECTACLES clattering to
the floor.


Before you can recover, ARCHY reaches
out and snags your arm, hauling you
up and pulling off the CARDIGAN.


You can see the fury in his snake eyes,
but you know that you've won. Smiling
a little manically, you laugh.


And with bravado, you face ARCHY down
as he uses his dark, admin arts to
turn you to stone.


You move without thinking, dodging
right and skirting the desk just as
ARCHY circles the other side of the
desk.


As quick as you can, you dash out of
the office and towards the BOOKCART,
which is right where you left it.


Leaping aboard, you call out...


With another whoosh and a brilliant
whirlwind of color, the BOOKCART
rockets you away, and you breathe
a sigh of relief.
